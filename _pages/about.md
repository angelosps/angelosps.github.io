Hello :wave: I am Angelos, a PhD student at [Boston University (BU)](https://www.bu.edu/), advised by Professors [Evimaria Terzi](https://cs-people.bu.edu/evimaria/) and [Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/). 

My research focuses on **mechanistic interpretability** of large language models (LLMs). Currently, I study how models encode *truth-related representations* and the geometry of these representations in activation space.

Before BU, I completed my B.Sc. in Informatics and Telecommunications at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://uoa.gr), Greece. During that time, I worked on evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs over description logic ontologies, advised by Prof. [Manolis Koubarakis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/). 

I also did a research internship at the [KDD Lab, NKUA](http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/), advised by Prof. [Dimitrios Gunopulos](http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/dg.html), where I worked on fairness algorithms in machine learning.
